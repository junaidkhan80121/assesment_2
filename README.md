# High Value Customers API and Frontend

This project consists of two parts:
1. **Backend (API)**: A Flask application that provides an API for fetching high-value customers.
2. **Frontend**: A React.js application that consumes the API and displays customer data in a sortable table.

## Project Setup

This project requires two main components:
- A **Flask backend** to manage the data and expose an API.
- A **React frontend** to consume that API and display the data in an interactive table.

Make sure you have **Python** and **Node.js** installed on your system.

---

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install **Flask** and **pymongo**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask pymongo
Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine (or on a remote server).
Running the Flask API
Clone the repository or create your own Flask app.

Update your MongoDB connection URL (if required) in app.py.

Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This will start the API server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Sample Data
You can populate the MongoDB collections with sample customer and order data by running the dummy_data.py script. This script will insert mock data into your MongoDB collections.

bash
Copy
Edit
python dummy_data.py
API Endpoints
GET /high-value-customers: This endpoint retrieves a list of high-value customers based on certain criteria (e.g., total spent, loyalty tier). The data is returned as a JSON array containing details such as name, email, total spent, loyalty tier, and more.
Frontend Setup
Prerequisites
Install Node.js and npm on your machine.

Install Axios and Material-UI:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install axios @mui/material
Running the React Application
Create a React app or clone the repository.

Place the provided App.js code in your main app component.

Make sure the frontend application connects to the correct backend URL (http://127.0.0.1:5000/high-value-customers).

Start the React development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
This will start the frontend app on http://localhost:3000/.

API Endpoints
1. GET /high-value-customers
This endpoint fetches the list of high-value customers. The response is a JSON object with the following structure:

[
  {
    "customerId": "C001",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "totalSpent": 1350,
    "averageOrderValue": 675,
    "loyaltyTier": "Silver",
    "lastPurchaseDate": "2024-02-15T00:00:00",
    "isActive": true,
    "favoriteCategory": "Clothing",
    "categoryWiseSpend": [
      { "category": "Electronics", "spend": 200 },
      { "category": "Clothing", "spend": 150 },
      { "category": "Clothing", "spend": 100 }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
Usage
React Frontend:
The React app allows you to view and interact with high-value customer data. It includes:

A sortable table for displaying customer information.
Sorting functionality on columns like Customer ID, Name, Total Spent, etc.
A modal that shows detailed customer information when you click on the "View Details" button.
Flask Backend:
The Flask backend provides the /high-value-customers endpoint, which fetches high-value customers based on their spending, loyalty tier, and activity. This data is then consumed by the React frontend.

Tech Stack
Backend:
Flask: A Python web framework used to build the API.
MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store customer and order data.
PyMongo: Python driver to interact with MongoDB.
Frontend:
React.js: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Material-UI: A React UI framework for styling and layout.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
